# Remote Pair Programming

There are lots of ways you can pair, so I am going to focus on how you would
pair using my tools (eg. you connect with me rather than me to you)

- - -

I start by making sure I have everything in order.

 * cd path/to/project
 * tmux -S /tmp/projectname-pair
 * setup tmux windows/panes
 * Start vim + nerdtree + taglist
 * Start guard if applicable

Now it's time for you to connect

First send me your ssh public key (See: *ssh-key*)

## TODO
 * Describe current setup in full
 * Give detailed steps for setup
